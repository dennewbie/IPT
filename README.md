## Progetto di Ingegneria del Software e Interazione Uomo-Macchina, Programmazione III - Università "Parthenope"

An urban transport company requires a software system for the management of all activities related to the management of employees, vehicles, their storage, and their communications to the citizens. The system must keep track of everything that concerns the employees, such as roles timetable shifts, salaries, and so on.  The software must allow the employees of the company with the role of HR, to view, insert and edit all data relating to the employees.

The warehouse is configured as a real vehicle parking, within which the company staff manages, through the use of the required software, the allocation of vehicles for individual rides. Every day at 7.00 am (hypothetical start of the shift), the employee must check the situation of the vehicles and determine which and how many can be used in daily rides, also considering the availability of drivers.

The system must also provide support to citizens for the retrieval of all information relating to rides and routes. Among the services offered to citizens, there is a search system for each line of the route made between two stations and a line search system that starts from one point and reaches another point.

It should be noted that in the phase of discovery, analysis of requirements and design was considered the entire track proposed earlier. Instead, the implementation part concerns only the part of the system that interfaces with citizens, providing the following services:

- Login and Registration
- Display of notices
- Display the newest information on lines and routes
- Route/Path finding
- Profile Management
- Travel Documents management and purchase
